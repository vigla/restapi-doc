Vigla.biz REST API and integration
==================================

Welcome to the documentation of `Vigla.biz`_ REST API and integration.

The following document will walk you through the steps of integrating private Monero payments
provided by Vigla into your e-commerce solution. The intended audience are developers and
we assume the reader is familiar with basic concepts of cryptocurrencies, web architecture and REST
APIs.

Should you have any general questions about what Vigla offers, please refer
to the `"How it works"`_ documentation.

.. note:: **Vigla is still in Beta phase** which means it is expected to still have bugs
        and design mistakes. The API described here is not the final version. Once we set
        the date of first stable release, all our users will be notified about the upcoming
        changes.
